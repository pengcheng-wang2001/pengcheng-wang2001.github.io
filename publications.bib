  abstract ={Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids, recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.}

  abstract={Algebras related to finite bijective or idempotent left non-degenerate solutions $(X,r)$ of the Yang--Baxter equation have been intensively studied. These are the monoid algebras $K[M(X,r)]$ and $K[A(X,r)]$, over a field $K$, of its structure monoid $M(X,r)$ and left derived structure monoid $A(X,r)$, which have quadratic defining relations.
    
In this paper we deal with arbitrary finite left non-degenerate solutions $(X,r)$. Via divisibility by generators, i.e., the elements of $X$, we construct an ideal chain in $M(X,r)$ that has very strong algebraic structural properties on its Rees factors. This allows to obtain characterizations of when the algebras $K[M(X,r)]$ and $K[A(X,r)]$ are left or right Noetherian. Intricate relationships between ring-theoretical and homological properties of these algebras and properties of the solution $(X,r)$ are proven, which extends known results on bijective non-degenerate solutions. Furthermore, we describe the cancellative congruences of $A(X,r)$ and $M(X,r)$ as well as the prime spectrum of $K[A(X,r)]$. This then leads  to an explicit formula for the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension of $K[M(X,r)]$ in terms of the number of orbits in $X$ under actions of certain finite monoids derived from $(X,r)$. It is also shown that the former coincides with the classical Krull dimension of $K[M(X,r)]$ in case the algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ is left or right Noetherian. Finally, we obtain the first structural results for a class of finite degenerate solutions $(X,r)$ of the form $r(x,y)=(\lambda_x(y),\rho(y))$ by showing that structure algebras of such solution are always right Noetherian.}

    abstract = {It is proven that finite idempotent left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions $(X,r)$ of the Yang–Baxter equation on a set $X$ are determined by a left simple semigroup structure on $X$ (in particular, a finite union of isomorphic copies of a group) and some maps $q$ and $\varphi_{x}$ on $X$, for $x\in X$. This structure turns out to be a group precisely when the associated Yang–Baxter monoid $M(X,r)$ is cancellative and all the maps $\varphi_{x}$ are equal to an automorphism of this group. Equivalently, the Yang–Baxter algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ is right Noetherian, or in characteristic zero it has to be semiprime. The Yang–Baxter algebra is always a left Noetherian representable algebra of Gelfand–Kirillov dimension one. To prove these results, it is shown that the Yang–Baxter semigroup $S(X,r)$ has a decomposition in finitely many cancellative semigroups $S_{u}$ indexed by the diagonal, each $S_{u}$ has a group of quotients $G_{u}$ that is finite-by-(infinite cyclic) and the union of these groups carries the structure of a left simple semigroup. The case that $X$ equals the diagonal is fully described by a single permutation on $X$.},

  abstract ={If $(X,r)$ is a finite non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang--Baxter equation, the additive group of the structure skew brace $G(X,r)$ is an FC-group, i.e. a group whose elements have finitely many conjugates. Moreover, its multiplicative group is virtually abelian, so it is also close to an FC-group itself. If one additionally assumes that the derived solution of $(X,r)$ is indecomposable, then for every element b of $G(X,r)$ there are finitely many elements of the form $b\ast c$ and $c\ast b$, with $c\in G(X,r)$. This naturally leads to the study of a brace-theoretic analogue of the class of FC-groups. For this class of skew braces, the fundamental results and their connections with the solutions of the YBE are described: we prove that they have good torsion and radical theories and they behave well with respect to certain nilpotency concepts and finite generation. },

       abstract = {To determine and analyze arbitrary left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (not necessarily bijective), we introduce an associative algebraic structure, called a YB-semitruss, that forms a subclass of the category of semitrusses as introduced by Brzeziński. Fundamental examples of YB-semitrusses are structure monoids of left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions and (skew) left braces. Gateva-Ivanova and Van den Bergh introduced structure monoids and showed their importance (as well as that of the structure algebra) for studying involutive non-degenerate solutions. Skew left braces were introduced by Guarnieri, Vendramin and Rump to deal with bijective non-degenerate solutions. Hence, YB-semitrusses also yield a unified treatment of these different algebraic structures. The algebraic structure of YB-semitrusses is investigated, and as a consequence, it is proven, for example, that any finite left non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation is right non-degenerate if and only if it is bijective. Furthermore, it is shown that some finite left non-degenerate solutions can be reduced to non-degenerate solutions of smaller size. The structure algebra of a finitely generated YB-semitruss is an algebra defined by homogeneous quadratic relations. We prove that it often is a left Noetherian algebra of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension that satisfies a polynomial identity, but in general, it is not right Noetherian.}

       abstract = {The distributive laws of ring theory are fundamental equalities in algebra. However, recently in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation, many algebraic structures with alternative "distributive" laws were defined. In an effort to study these "left distributive" laws and the interaction they entail on the algebraic structures, Brzeziński introduced skew left trusses and left semi-trusses. In particular the class of left semi-trusses is very wide, since it contains all rings, associative algebras and distributive lattices. In this paper, we investigate the subclass of left semi-trusses that behave like the algebraic structures that came up in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation. We study the interaction of the operations and what this interaction entails on their respective semigroups. In particular, we prove that in the finite case the additive structure is a completely regular semigroup. Secondly, we apply our results on a particular instance of a left semi-truss called an almost left semi-brace, introduced by Miccoli to study its algebraic structure. In particular, we show that one can associate a left semi-brace to any almost left semi-brace. Furthermore, we show that the set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation originating from almost left semi-braces arise from this correspondence.}

We give a description of all involutive solutions, i.e., $s^2=id$. It is shown that such solutions are determined by a factorization of $S$ as direct product $X\times A\times G$ and a map $\sigma:A\to Sym(X)$, where $X$ is a non-empty set and $A$,$G$ are elementary abelian $2$-groups. Isomorphic solutions are determined by the cardinalities of $A$, $G$ and $X$, i.e., the map $\sigma$ is irrelevant. In particular, if $S$ is finite of cardinality $2^n(2m+1)$ for some $n,m\geq 0$ then, on $S$, there are precisely $\binom{n+2}{2}$ non-isomorphic solutions of the Pentagon Equation.}
