# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interest focuses on studying algebraic structures associated with discrete versions of some equations in mathematical physics, such as the Yang-Baxter equation and the Pentagon equation. I am mainly interested in algebraic structures such as skew braces, trusses and generalisations that organise, classify and help to find solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and the Pentagon equation with given properties.

In June 2024, I will begin my new role as a Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds in the UK.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter (UK). I am working on the EPSRC project: Hopf-Galois Theory and Skew Braces (PI: Prof. N. Byott).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in the group ALGB: Algebra, Incidence Geometry (Group and Semigroup Theory) headed by Prof. E. Jespers.

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of Salento under the supervision of Prof. F. Catino. During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at the University of Warsaw in the group of Algebra and Number Theory headed by Prof. J. Okniński.

My PhD thesis focuses on studying a novel algebraic structure, namely semi-brace, and its connection with set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.
