I am Pengcheng Wang, a Ph.D. Student in Biomedical Engineering at University of Southern California (USC), advised by
Professor [Zhaoyang Fan](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/zhaoyang-fan/), in
the [Fan Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/fan-mri-lab/) since Fall 2023. Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree
from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). When I was in my undergraduate, I am so fortunate to work
with Dr. [Yan-Ran Wang](http://yanranwang.com). My research interest is in Biomedical Artificial
Intelligence, focusing on the interdisciplinary areas that encompass Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Signal and Image
Processing, Medical Image Analysis, Biomedical Imaging (MRI), and data science.
