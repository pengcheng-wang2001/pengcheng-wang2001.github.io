abstract: Algebras related to finite bijective or idempotent left non-degenerate solutions
  $(X,r)$ of the Yang--Baxter equation have been intensively studied. These are the
  monoid algebras $K[M(X,r)]$ and $K[A(X,r)]$, over a field $K$, of its structure
  monoid $M(X,r)$ and left derived structure monoid $A(X,r)$, which have quadratic
  defining relations.  In this paper we deal with arbitrary finite left non-degenerate
  solutions $(X,r)$. Via divisibility by generators, i.e., the elements of $X$, we
  construct an ideal chain in $M(X,r)$ that has very strong algebraic structural properties
  on its Rees factors. This allows to obtain characterizations of when the algebras
  $K[M(X,r)]$ and $K[A(X,r)]$ are left or right Noetherian. Intricate relationships
  between ring-theoretical and homological properties of these algebras and properties
  of the solution $(X,r)$ are proven, which extends known results on bijective non-degenerate
  solutions. Furthermore, we describe the cancellative congruences of $A(X,r)$ and
  $M(X,r)$ as well as the prime spectrum of $K[A(X,r)]$. This then leads  to an explicit
  formula for the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension of $K[M(X,r)]$ in terms of the number
  of orbits in $X$ under actions of certain finite monoids derived from $(X,r)$. It
  is also shown that the former coincides with the classical Krull dimension of $K[M(X,r)]$
  in case the algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ is left or right Noetherian. Finally, we obtain
  the first structural results for a class of finite degenerate solutions $(X,r)$
  of the form $r(x,y)=(łambda_x(y),h̊o(y))$ by showing that structure algebras of
  such solution are always right Noetherian.
