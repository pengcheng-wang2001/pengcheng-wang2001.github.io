abstract: 'We present a characterization of simple finite non-degenerate bijective
  set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in terms of the algebraic structure
  of the associated permutation skew left braces. In particular, we prove that they
  need to have a unique minimal non-zero ideal and modulo this ideal one obtains a
  trivial skew left brace of cyclic type. '
