 abstract = {We present a characterization of simple finite non-degenerate bijective set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in terms of the algebraic structure of the associated permutation skew left braces.
In particular, we prove that they need to have a unique minimal non-zero ideal and modulo this ideal one obtains a trivial skew left brace of cyclic type. },
