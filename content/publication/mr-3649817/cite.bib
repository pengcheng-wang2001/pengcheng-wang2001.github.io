 abstract = {In this paper we obtain new solutions of the Yangâ€“Baxter equation that are left non-degenerate through left semi-braces, a generalization of braces introduced by Rump. In order to provide new solutions we introduce the asymmetric product of left semi-braces, a generalization of the semidirect product of braces, that allows us to produce several examples of left semi-braces.},
