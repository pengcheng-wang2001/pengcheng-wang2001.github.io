abstract: In this paper we obtain new solutions of the Yangâ€“Baxter equation that are
  left non-degenerate through left semi-braces, a generalization of braces introduced
  by Rump. In order to provide new solutions we introduce the asymmetric product of
  left semi-braces, a generalization of the semidirect product of braces, that allows
  us to produce several examples of left semi-braces.
