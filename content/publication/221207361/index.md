abstract: It is proven that finite idempotent left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions
  $(X,r)$ of the Yang–Baxter equation on a set $X$ are determined by a left simple
  semigroup structure on $X$ (in particular, a finite union of isomorphic copies of
  a group) and some maps $q$ and $ǎrphi_x$ on $X$, for $xın X$. This structure turns
  out to be a group precisely when the associated Yang–Baxter monoid $M(X,r)$ is cancellative
  and all the maps $řphi_x$ are equal to an automorphism of this group. Equivalently,
  the Yang–Baxter algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ is right Noetherian, or in characteristic zero
  it has to be semiprime. The Yang–Baxter algebra is always a left Noetherian representable
  algebra of Gelfand–Kirillov dimension one. To prove these results, it is shown that
  the Yang–Baxter semigroup $S(X,r)$ has a decomposition in finitely many cancellative
  semigroups $S_u$ indexed by the diagonal, each $S_u$ has a group of quotients $G_u$
  that is finite-by-(infinite cyclic) and the union of these groups carries the structure
  of a left simple semigroup. The case that $X$ equals the diagonal is fully described
  by a single permutation on $X$.
