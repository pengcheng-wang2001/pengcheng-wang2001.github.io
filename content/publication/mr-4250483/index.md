abstract: This paper aims to introduce a construction technique of set-theoretic solutions
  of the Yang-Baxter equation, called strong semilattice of solutions. This technique,
  inspired by the strong semilattice of semigroups, allows one to obtain new solutions.
  In particular, this method turns out to be useful to provide non-bijective solutions
  of finite order. It is well-known braces, skew braces and semi-braces are closely
  linked with solutions. Hence, we introduce a generalization of the algebraic structure
  of semi-braces based on this new construction technique of solutions.
