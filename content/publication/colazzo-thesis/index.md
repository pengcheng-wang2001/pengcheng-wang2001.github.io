abstract: 'This thesis focuses on the new algebraic structure: semi-brace. We study
  basic properties of this structure and we show that semi-braces are a generalization
  of braces. Moreover we introduce new constructions of semi-braces, the asymmetric
  product and the matched product, in order to obtain several examples of semi- braces.
  Finally, we prove that we may construct left non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter
  equation through left semi-braces.'
