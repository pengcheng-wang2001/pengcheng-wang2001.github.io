abstract: In this work, we develop a novel construction technique for set-theoretical
  solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Our technique, named the matched product,
  is an innovative tool to construct new classes of involutive solutions as the matched
  product of two involutive solutions is still involutive, and vice versa. This method
  produces new examples of idempotent solutions as the matched product of other idempotent
  ones. We translate the construction in the context of semi-braces, which are algebraic
  structures tightly linked with solutions that generalize the braces introduced by
  Rump. In addition, we show that the solution associated to the matched product of
  two semi-braces is indeed the matched product of the solutions associated to those
  two semi-braces.
