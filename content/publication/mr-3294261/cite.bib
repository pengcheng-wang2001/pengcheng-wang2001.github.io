 abstract = {Catino and Rizzo [‘Regular subgroups of the affine group and radical circle algebras’, Bull. Aust. Math. Soc.79 (2009), 103–107] established a link between regular subgroups of the affine group and the radical brace over a field on the underlying vector space. We propose new constructions of radical braces that allow us to obtain systematic constructions of regular subgroups of the affine group. In particular, this approach allows to put in a more general context the regular subgroups constructed in Tamburini Bellani [‘Some remarks on regular subgroups of the affine group’ Int. J. Group Theory, 1 (2012), 17–23].},
