abstract: Catino and Rizzo [‘Regular subgroups of the affine group and radical circle
  algebras’, Bull. Aust. Math. Soc.79 (2009), 103–107] established a link between
  regular subgroups of the affine group and the radical brace over a field on the
  underlying vector space. We propose new constructions of radical braces that allow
  us to obtain systematic constructions of regular subgroups of the affine group.
  In particular, this approach allows to put in a more general context the regular
  subgroups constructed in Tamburini Bellani [‘Some remarks on regular subgroups of
  the affine group’ Int. J. Group Theory, 1 (2012), 17–23].
