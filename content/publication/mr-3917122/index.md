abstract: We describe the class of all skew left braces with non-trivial annihilator
  through ideal extension of a skew left brace. The ideal extension of skew left braces
  is a generalization to the non-abelian case of the extension of left braces provided
  by Bachiller in [D. Bachiller, Extensions, matched products, and simple braces,
  J. Pure Appl. Algebra222 (2018) 1670â€“1691].
