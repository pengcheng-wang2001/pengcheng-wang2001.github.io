 abstract = {We describe the class of all skew left braces with non-trivial annihilator through ideal extension of a skew left brace. The ideal extension of skew left braces is a generalization to the non-abelian case of the extension of left braces provided by Bachiller in [D. Bachiller, Extensions, matched products, and simple braces, J. Pure Appl. Algebra222 (2018) 1670â€“1691].},
