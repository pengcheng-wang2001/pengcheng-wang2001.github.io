abstract: The workshop was focused on the interplay between set-theoretic solutions
  to the Yang–Baxter equation and several algebraic structures used to construct and
  understand new solutions. In this vein, the YBE and properties of these algebraic
  structures are used as a source of inspiration to study other mathematical problems
  not directly related to the YBE.
