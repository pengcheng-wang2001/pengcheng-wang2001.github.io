 abstract = {The workshop was focused on the interplay between set-theoretic solutions to the Yang–Baxter equation and several algebraic structures used to construct and understand new solutions. In this vein, the YBE and properties of these algebraic structures are used as a source of inspiration to study other mathematical problems not directly related to the YBE.},
