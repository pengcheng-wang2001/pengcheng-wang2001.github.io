abstract: In this paper we introduce the asymmetric product of radical braces, a construction
  which extends the semidirect product of radical braces. This new construction allows
  to obtain rather systematic constructions of regular subgroups of the affine group
  and, in particular, our approach allows to put in a more general context the regular
  subgroups constructed by Heged≈±s (2000)
