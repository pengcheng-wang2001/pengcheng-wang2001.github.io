abstract: The distributive laws of ring theory are fundamental equalities in algebra.
  However, recently in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation, many algebraic structures
  with alternative \"distributive\" laws were defined. In an effort to study these
  \"left distributive\" laws and the interaction they entail on the algebraic structures,
  Brzeziński introduced skew left trusses and left semi-trusses. In particular the
  class of left semi-trusses is very wide, since it contains all rings, associative
  algebras and distributive lattices. In this paper, we investigate the subclass of
  left semi-trusses that behave like the algebraic structures that came up in the
  study of the Yang-Baxter equation. We study the interaction of the operations and
  what this interaction entails on their respective semigroups. In particular, we
  prove that in the finite case the additive structure is a completely regular semigroup.
  Secondly, we apply our results on a particular instance of a left semi-truss called
  an almost left semi-brace, introduced by Miccoli to study its algebraic structure.
  In particular, we show that one can associate a left semi-brace to any almost left
  semi-brace. Furthermore, we show that the set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter
  equation originating from almost left semi-braces arise from this correspondence.
