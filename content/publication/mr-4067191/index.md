abstract: In this work, we focus on the set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter
  equation which are of finite order and not necessarily bijective. We use the matched
  product of solutions as a unifying tool for treating these solutions of finite order,
  that also include involutive and idempotent solutions. In particular, we prove that
  the matched product of two solutions $r_S$ and $r_T$ is of finite order if and only
  if $r_S$ and $r_T$ are. Furthermore, we show that with sufficient information on
  $r_S$ and $r_T$ we can precisely establish the order of the matched product. Finally,
  we prove that if $B$ is a finite semi-brace, then the associated solution $r$ satisfies
  $r^n=r$, for an integer $n$ closely linked with $B$
