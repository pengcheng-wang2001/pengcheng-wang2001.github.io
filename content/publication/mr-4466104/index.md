abstract: To determine and analyze arbitrary left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions
  of the Yang-Baxter equation (not necessarily bijective), we introduce an associative
  algebraic structure, called a YB-semitruss, that forms a subclass of the category
  of semitrusses as introduced by Brzezi≈Ñski. Fundamental examples of YB-semitrusses
  are structure monoids of left non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions and (skew)
  left braces. Gateva-Ivanova and Van den Bergh introduced structure monoids and showed
  their importance (as well as that of the structure algebra) for studying involutive
  non-degenerate solutions. Skew left braces were introduced by Guarnieri, Vendramin
  and Rump to deal with bijective non-degenerate solutions. Hence, YB-semitrusses
  also yield a unified treatment of these different algebraic structures. The algebraic
  structure of YB-semitrusses is investigated, and as a consequence, it is proven,
  for example, that any finite left non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter
  equation is right non-degenerate if and only if it is bijective. Furthermore, it
  is shown that some finite left non-degenerate solutions can be reduced to non-degenerate
  solutions of smaller size. The structure algebra of a finitely generated YB-semitruss
  is an algebra defined by homogeneous quadratic relations. We prove that it often
  is a left Noetherian algebra of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension that satisfies
  a polynomial identity, but in general, it is not right Noetherian.
