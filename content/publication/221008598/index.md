abstract: 'If $(X,r)$ is a finite non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang--Baxter
  equation, the additive group of the structure skew brace $G(X,r)$ is an FC-group,
  i.e. a group whose elements have finitely many conjugates. Moreover, its multiplicative
  group is virtually abelian, so it is also close to an FC-group itself. If one additionally
  assumes that the derived solution of $(X,r)$ is indecomposable, then for every element
  b of $G(X,r)$ there are finitely many elements of the form $b* c$ and $c* b$, with
  $cın G(X,r)$. This naturally leads to the study of a brace-theoretic analogue of
  the class of FC-groups. For this class of skew braces, the fundamental results and
  their connections with the solutions of the YBE are described: we prove that they
  have good torsion and radical theories and they behave well with respect to certain
  nilpotency concepts and finite generation. '
