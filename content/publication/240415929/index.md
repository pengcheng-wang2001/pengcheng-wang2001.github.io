abstract: Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate
  solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids,
  recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate
  solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing
  left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate
  solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence
  between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.
