 abstract = {Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids, recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.},
